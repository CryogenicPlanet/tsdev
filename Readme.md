# Tsdev (Zero Config Modern Typescript Projects)


## Motivation

I really like the idea behind https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx but I find it uses older tools and it ends up taking time for me to setup my typescript packages anyways. So I wanted to make something like it that fit my stack and preferred tools better, something that obfuscates all the configuration needed to run modern typescript applications and allows use to get started instantly.


## Get started

```bash
npm install -g tsdev-installer

tsdev create {name}
```


## Features

- Instantly bootstrap typescript apps for `express`, `react` and `next`
- Automatically handles all `eslint` and `prettier` config
- Comes with built in `dev` mode with in built watcher
- Use very fast built tools, like `esbuild` and `vite`
- Inbuilt config and setup for `tailwind`
- Has tooling for bundling `.dts` with `dts-bundle`
- Has defaults for publishing `react` packages with `vite-library-mode`
    - Adds support for `twind` (tailwind as css-in-js) so you can publish react packages while using tailwind with tiny bundles. This also has better support when use in `next`
